## Description

Given a starting dollar value of $10,000, ùúÜ (risk tolerance) 1, ùë§max (maximum possible ratio of portfolio allocated to one stock) 0.05, and ùêø (moving window size) 28 weeks, a Markowitz mean-variance model was built to maximize the possible returns while accounting for volatility in stock price movements. The final model resulted in an over 40% return on initial investment across a period of multiple years, a 4.9% overperformance from the S&P 500 which it drew its data from. Code was created in a Jupyter notebook using Python libraries such as yfinance for data gathering, pandas for data manipulation, numpy for advanced calculations, and pulp for optimization.
